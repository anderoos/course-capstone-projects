# Analyzing Life Expectancy and GDP
This project's starter files were provided by Codecademy Data Analytics Career Path. The starter file contains data between 2000 and 2015 for 6 different counties, containing GDP information and life expectancy rates.

#### -- Project Status: [Complete] --

## Abstract
The purpose of this project is to practice visualization and analysis. Given this small data, summary statistics were not performed, and visualizations were created to quickly describe the dataset.


### Technologies
* Python 3
* Jupyter Labs
* Adobe Illustrator

## Conclusions
* Between 2000 and 2015, Germany had the highest life expectancy, followed by Chile, then USA.

* Zimbabwe had the lowest life expectancy in this dataset during this period.

* Life expectancy in this dataset floats around 70 to 80.

* Chile has a high life expectancy rate despite having lower GDP compared to USA, Germany and China
