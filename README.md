# Course Capstone Projects
## About
This repository is an aggregate of smaller course-related capstone projects, associated with courses from Codecademy and Coursera. The goal of this repository is to reduce repository clutter and showcase achievements in my journey of data science and analytics. This repo is a compliment of my coursework from [Columbia Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://github.com/anderoos/columbia-data-bootcamp).

## Capstone Projects

### Analyzing Life Expectancy and GDP
**Code/ Folder:** [01-life-expectancy-gdp](https://github.com/anderoos/course-capstone-projects/tree/main/01-life-expectancy-gdp) <br>
**Description:** An exploration into GDP and Life expectancy for six countries between 2000 and 2015. This project was completed for the Codecademy Data Analytics Capstone. <br>
**Tech-stack:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`<br>
**Results/ Presentation:** [Summary Document](https://github.com/anderoos/course-capstone-projects/blob/main/01-life-expectancy-gdp/README.md)<br>
<br>
### Exploring Biodiversity in US National Parks
**Code/ Folder:** [biodiversity.ipynb](https://github.com/anderoos/course-capstone-projects/blob/main/02-biodiversity-exploration/biodiversity.ipynb)<br>
**Description:** An exploration into a biodiversity dataset. <br>
**Tech-stack:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`<br>
**Results/ Presentation:**  Aquatic and mammalian species are at greatest risk and are consistent across all National Parks. <br>
<br>
### Analyzing US Medical Insurance Costs
**Code/ Folder:**  [insurance_summary.ipynb](https://github.com/anderoos/course-capstone-projects/blob/main/03-us-medical-insurance-cost/insurance_summary.ipynb)<br>
**Description:** A dive into US medical conditions and its impact on US medical insurance rates.<br>
**Tech-stack:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`<br>
<br>
### In-Demand Skills from StackOverflow
**Code/ Folder:**  [summary_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/anderoos/course-capstone-projects/blob/main/04-stackoverflow-analysis/summary_analysis.ipynb)<br>
**Description:** Using StackOverflow survey data aggregated between 2018 and 2020, I wanted to explore what are the most in-demand skills required to enter the data analytics industry.<br>
**Tech-stack:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`<br>
**Results/ Presentation:**  Most in demand DMSs are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, MongoDB and SQLite<br>
<br>
### Causal Analysis: Cell Phone Usage and Auto Accidents
**Code/ Folder:** [crash-EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/anderoos/course-capstone-projects/blob/main/05-cell-phone-usage-crashes/crash_EDA.ipynb) <br>
**Description:** This analysis uses publicly available data from NHTSA and the Pew Research Center to perform a causal analysis of smartphone usage and fatal auto accidents.<br>
**Tech-stack:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `datetime`, `scipy`<br>
**Results/ Presentation:** Although this data suggests that there is no relationship between smartphone usage and auto accidents, it does shed insight to the number of drivers who text and drive *without* smartphones. As demonstrated in the analysis, there is a notable decrease in auto accidents between the years 2009 and 2012. This may be attributed to the DOT's texting and driving ads shown on television during this time. Smartphone usage took off after 2011, this may suggest that there is a percentage of people in the population do text and drive without the need of a smartphone like iPhone or android. <br>
<br>
### A/B Testing for MSU's Library Dataset
**Code/ Folder:** [exploratory.ipynb](https://github.com/anderoos/course-capstone-projects/blob/main/06-ab-testing/exploratory.ipynb) <br>
**Description:** We seek to strengthen MSU Library's CTA language and encourage to click on the "Interact" link. This interact CTA allows students to access library resources such as hours, floorplans, faculty, and more.<br>
**Tech-stack:** `Google Analytics`, `CrazyEgg`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `datetime`, `scipy`, `regex`<br>
**Results/ Presentation:** [ab_test_ppt_pdf.pdf](https://github.com/anderoos/course-capstone-projects/blob/main/06-ab-testing/ab_test_ppt_pdf.pdf)<br>
